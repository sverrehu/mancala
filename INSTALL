Building on a Un*x system
-------------------------

You _will_ have to edit the Makefile to compile the programs.  At
least you should check the defines CC, XINCDIR, XLIBDIR and OPTIM.
I've only built this using GNU make and GNU gcc.  Please let me know
if you have to make major changes to make this work using other tools.

To make the X11 version, you need the XForms-library by T.C. Zhao and
Mark Overmars.  This nice software is available by anonymous ftp from

     ftp://laue.phys.uwm.edu/pub/xforms  

The API of XForms changed a bit between version 0.75 and 0.81.  This
version on Mancala is updated to compile with 0.81.

Typing `make' will attempt to build both the text based version and
the X11 version.  Run `make mancala' or `make xmancala' to build only
one of the programs.


Building on MS-DOS
------------------

Only the text based program is available on MS-DOS.  The file
Makefile.bcc should let you compile mancala using Borland's
bcc-compiler.  Try `make -f Makefile.bcc'.  If you don't have bcc, but
you have another C compiler, compile and link mancala.c, minimax.c and
textmain.c to mancala.exe.  Note that I don't check to see that every
new version compiles on MS-DOS.  Let me know if it doesn't.

If you should happen to make a Windows interface to this program,
please let me know!
