This is an implementation of the simple, but fun board game known as
Mancala.  For rules of the game, see RULES.

A simple character/terminal-based version of the game can be compiled
on both Un*x- and MS-DOS-systems.  A fancy windowing version requires
the X Window System.  See INSTALL for brief instructions on how to
build the programs.
